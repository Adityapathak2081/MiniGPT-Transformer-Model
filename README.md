# MiniGPT-Transformer-Model
This is a ML based project. I've created this ML model that is similar to ChatGPT, but this is focused solely to mental health support.
I've distributed the dataset into training and testing sets. When model is trained , the loss function in each epoch keeps reducing and forms a hyperparabolic curve and ends up minimising the cost.
The LLM gives predictions with an accuracy of 0.792 (R^2).
